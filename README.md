# gameclock

A preact module for a game clock, supporting an arbitrary number of players.

## Demo

[View the live demo by clicking here.](https://dbosst.github.io/gameclock-demo/demo/index.html)

Note: the interface options for the clock are only part of the demo, not the module itself. Also, the images inside each player's clock are part of the demo css, not a module option.

You can also just use the demo for your personal needs (if you aren't attaching the module to a program), and save your own timing presets to a text file by copy/pasting the state with the demo's import/export feature.

## Features

Support for various timing modes:
* Go's byo-yomi / (Canadian) overtime
* Chess' Delay (Bronstein) Timing
* Chess' Increment (Fischer) Timing (before & after)
* Hourglass
* Word game timing (negative time counting)
* Absolute (egg-timer)

Customizable display:
* Display elapsed or remaining time/periods/phase/moves
* Customizable display text & information (player name, time expired text, periods, etc.)
* Fractional seconds customization (0-4 decimal places, update interval)

Adjustable clock:
* Pause the clock first, and then adjust the current player clock.
* Also, change the active player by pausing and making a move.

Callback events, including:
* On last 10 seconds (of current period/phase)
* Time Expired
* Made move
* Pause, Resume, Reset, Init

CSS classes:
* Style the game clock or each individual player clock
* Style each player clock according to the clock state: expired, running, paused, init.

## Build the demo
Pre-requisites: You need Node.js, npm, and preact installed to build the demo.

Then download this demo with `git` and use `npm` to install the dependencies:

~~~
$ git clone https://github.com/dbosst/gameclock

$ npm install
~~~

Then to create the bundle, you can either build the development demo once:

~~~

Or use the `watch-demo` script for development:

~~~
$ npm run watch-demo
